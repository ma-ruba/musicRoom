# musicRoom
This is an App for sharing and creating playlists with your friends.
It was initially created for the Ecole42 School in Moscow as a part of the project and later refactored.

In this app  user can create an account, log in and create and refactor playlists with their friends collaboration. The one can also make and modify his list of friends. 

 A lot more features are coming soon!
This version lacks it's key feature - deffered events for the friends. User will be able to create an event for his friends and specify time and location. All together they will have an opportunity to create a playlist for a party or any other occasion. At the specified time all friends located in the specified zone will be able to vote for the tracks and thus determine the order of playback.

Moreover, an app for AppleWatch on SwiftUi is planned that will enable to play and pause a track just from your wrist.
